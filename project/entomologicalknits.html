        <h4>Objective</h4>
        <p>
          To highlight the often-overlooked intricacies of knitting, preserving
          its rich history while reimagining its relevance in modern
          craftsmanship. This project aimed to spark curiosity and encourage
          viewers to see knitting as an art form, distinct from its traditional
          associations with garments.
        </p>

        <h4>Background and Concept</h4>
        <p>
          In this final project at the
          <a href="https://www.rca.ac.uk/" target="_blank"
            >Royal College of Art</a
          >, I sought to draw attention to the fading presence of needlecrafts,
          focusing on knitting as a medium to capture this sentiment. Inspired
          by traditional knitting techniques and patterns, I wanted to emphasize
          the artistry behind functional elements like sock heels, pockets,
          gussets, and ribs. The project was also influenced by vintage knitting
          patterns, where I found appreciation for the technical beauty in these
          craft details, which are often obscured within garments.

        <h4>Design Process</h4>
        <p>
          To achieve the vision, I adopted a museum-inspired display format,
          presenting each knitted piece behind glass with accompanying labels.
          This presentation, by removing the tactile element, was intended to
          inspire curiosity and encourage viewers to study the pieces more
          closely, almost as artifacts. The labels included detailed knitting
          techniques for those interested in the technical aspects, inviting a
          more in-depth exploration.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each knitted element was produced in a range of colors, reflecting
          modern manufacturing trends where garments are mass-produced in varied
          colorways. This repetition with color variation was intentional,
          underscoring the contrast between traditional handcrafting and
          contemporary production practices.
        </p>

        <h4>Reflecting Craftsmanship in Modern Context</h4>
        <p>
          Moving away from the typical use of knitting for garments, the work
          was designed to stand alone as a collection of details, isolating the
          craftsmanship so it could be appreciated independently. The display
          emphasized the unique beauty of each stitch, seam, and technique,
          creating an atmosphere that allowed viewers to contemplate knittingâ€™s
          historical and artistic significance in a new light.

        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>
          By reframing knitting as art, I aimed to encourage viewers to engage
          with the medium differently, seeing it as both an element of cultural
          heritage and a vibrant form of personal expression. This exhibition
          created a platform to preserve the delicate art of knitting, prompting
          reflection on its past and its place in modern craft.
