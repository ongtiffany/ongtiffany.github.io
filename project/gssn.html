            <h4>Facilitating Discourse and Research</h4>
            <p>The German Screen Studies Network (GSSN) was established in June 2012 to serve as a platform for facilitating discourse and promoting German-language film among researchers, educators, film professionals, and the general public. Central to its mission are various initiatives including the annual GSSN symposium, film talks, workshops, and school events, all aimed at fostering public discussion and debate on German-language screen media.</p>
            
            <p>At the heart of the GSSN's activities is its role as a research hub, serving both national and international scholars interested in German-language screen media. Through its symposium and other events, the network provides a forum for scholars to exchange ideas, present research findings, and engage in critical dialogue. Additionally, it offers a resource base for researchers and professionals seeking comprehensive information and insights into German cinema and media studies. Beyond academic discourse, the GSSN also plays a crucial role in promoting German-language films and other screen media to a wider anglophone audience. By curating events and initiatives that showcase the richness and diversity of German cinema, the network seeks to increase awareness and appreciation of German-language films among audiences worldwide.</p>

            <p>The original site was hosted on tumblr, with a logo that was quickly created using a word document. They wanted a new logo, keeping the abbreviations but also with a full title version, but with more refinement and identity to be used online and printed material.</p>

            <h4>Designing a Distinctive Identity</h4>
            <p>The design process for the German Screen Studies Network (GSSN) project was meticulous and collaborative, with a focus on creating a visually compelling and user-friendly platform. As this was my first project at King's Digital Lab, I approached it with enthusiasm and a commitment to delivering a high-quality design solution.  Working closely with another designer who managed the project, we began by gathering the client's requirements and conducting thorough research to understand the goals and audience of the GSSN.</p>
            <p>Once the requirements were established, we delved into the design phase, starting with the creation of logo concepts. Drawing inspiration from various sources, including German flags and film aesthetics, we sketched multiple ideas to capture the essence of the GSSN brand. Through internal discussions and feedback sessions, we refined the logo concepts to align with the client's vision and objectives. The final logo design aimed to convey professionalism, cultural relevance, and a sense of community.</p>

            <h4>Iterative Design Process</h4>
            <p>Simultaneously, we embarked on designing the website, starting with the site map and defining page content and functionality requirements. Collaborating closely with the project manager and development team, we iteratively refined the website's design to ensure seamless navigation, engaging visual elements, and intuitive user interactions. Incorporating feedback from stakeholders and user testing sessions, we fine-tuned the design to meet the diverse needs of GSSN's audience, including scholars, educators, film professionals, and enthusiasts.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Throughout the design process, we adhered to principles of user-centered design, prioritizing the needs and preferences of the target audience. We also emphasized consistency in branding and visual elements to reinforce the GSSN's identity across all touchpoints. By leveraging design best practices and innovative solutions, we aimed to create a platform that not only showcased the richness of German-language screen media but also fostered a sense of community and collaboration among its members.</p>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>The German Screen Studies Network (GSSN) stands as a testament to the power of collaboration and dialogue in fostering a deeper understanding and appreciation of German-language screen media. Through its diverse array of initiatives, including symposiums, film talks, and workshops, the GSSN has provided a vital platform for scholars, professionals, and enthusiasts to come together, exchange ideas, and explore the rich tapestry of German cinema. As the network continues to evolve and expand its reach, it remains committed to promoting German-language films to a global audience and serving as a catalyst for continued research, discourse, and engagement in the field of German screen studies.</p>
