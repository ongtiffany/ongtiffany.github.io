        <h4>Exploring Data for Enhanced Representation</h4>
        <p>
          Upon my return to work from maternity leave at
          <a href="https://kdl.kcl.ac.uk" target="_blank">King's Digital Lab</a
          >. I revisited the notes from the Shakespeare in the Royal Collection
          project. It struck me that certain key points outlined in the initial
          documents were not adequately represented on the staging site. One
          particular aspect that caught my attention was a response from the
          questionnaire provided to our partners, which emphasized the need to
          "Summarize & prioritize your goals for the site? - Illustrate/support
          an argument about the relationship between Shakespeare and the
          royals". This prompted me to consider how a visual representation
          using relevant data could effectively capture and convey these initial
          thoughts and ideas. Utilising my allocated 10% time at
          <a href="https://kdl.kcl.ac.uk" target="_blank">King's Digital Lab</a
          >, I embarked on some initial exploratory work to address this gap.
        </p>

        <h4>Evolving from Concept to Sketches</h4>
        <p>
          This project is still in its nascent stages, evolving from initial
          mockup concepts to the exploration of ideas in greater detail. The
          process involves iterating on various design concepts, experimenting
          with different approaches, and refining them based on feedback and
          feasibility. Much of this work has been carried out using Illustrator,
          where data points are plotted manually to visualize patterns and
          trends. As the project progresses, the aim is to further refine these
          mockups, integrating more intricate details and exploring innovative
          techniques to enhance the visualization of data. Each iteration brings
          us closer to achieving a refined and impactful design solution that
          effectively communicates the underlying information to the intended
          audience.

        <h4>Version 1: Visualising Object Acquisition Over Time</h4>
        <p>
          The initial concept aimed to provide an insightful overview of the
          objects acquired by different acquirers over time through a layered
          timeline. The x-axis would represent the lifespans of the acquirers,
          while the y-axis would depict the number of objects they acquired each
          year. This visual representation would allow for a quick and easy
          identification of the top and bottom acquirers, along with when they
          lived. The intention was to offer a high-level perspective, while also
          enabling users to delve deeper into the individual objects acquired by
          each person for more detailed exploration.
        </p>

        <p>
          To enhance the richness of the visualisation and cater to public
          interest, additional data points such as coronation dates, weddings,
          and information about dependents were incorporated. These types of
          data are typically of interest to the general public and are easily
          accessible, fostering greater engagement with the visualisation. By
          combining these diverse data sets, the goal was to uncover any
          potential patterns or correlations that may emerge, shedding light on
          the relationships between the acquirers and the objects they acquired.
          Ultimately, the visualisation aimed to provide a comprehensive and
          insightful exploration of the historical context surrounding the
          acquisition of objects by different individuals.
        </p>

          <img
            src="../img/project/sharc/prototype1.jpg"
            alt="prototype version 1"
          />
          <figcaption>Version 1</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Although this layout could possibly show a lot of information, I had
          feedback that it was also very confusing. In particular, the
          combination of the smaller charts within. Overlaying would be a big
          issue if a several acquirers had similar number of objects and
          timelines.
        </p>

        <h4>Version 2: Simplified for more Clarity and Accessibility</h4>
        <p>
          This layout underwent adaptations from its predecessor, Version 1,
          primarily involving the removal of the y-axis and dependents. In this
          revised version, the x-axis still represents time, with each rectangle
          symbolising a person. The width of each rectangle corresponds to the
          individual's lifespan, with birth years arranged chronologically from
          top to bottom. Notable events such as coronations are represented by
          orange triangles or crown icons, while weddings are denoted by blue
          triangles or flower icons. The objects acquired by each individual are
          depicted as squares, positioned along the x-axis according to the
          timeline of their acquisition. The height of each rectangle is
          indicative of the total number of objects acquired by the respective
          individual. This streamlined approach aims to enhance clarity and
          simplify the visual representation of data, making it more accessible
          and intuitive for users to interpret.
        </p>
        <p>
          This would solve the overlay issue but with about 60 acquirers, the
          cascading step effect might look very messy and take a lot of space.
        </p>

        <figure class="small">
          <img
            src="../img/project/sharc/prototype2.jpg"
            alt="prototype version 2"
          />
          <figcaption>Version 2</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h4>Version 3: Streamlined Layout for more Focus</h4>
        <p>
          The third version of the layout has been streamlined to focus on and
          highlight specific information in a cleaner format. At the outset of
          the project, I was tasked with designing the project's logo, a request
          made by the partners. I aimed to integrate the style of the logo into
          the next prototype version.
        </p>

        <figure class="small">
          <img src="../img/project/sharc/logo.jpg" alt="some logo options" />
          <figcaption>
            Some logo ideas and variations and final ones outlined
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          In this iteration, there are no axes. Each square represents a person
          and can be arranged chronologically by birth year, starting from the
          top left and moving right downwards. In the example provided below,
          individuals are grouped by century and by the number of objects
          acquired. This arrangement offers a clearer understanding of the
          number of acquirers per century, facilitating easy comparison if
          necessary. The triangles provide a rough overview of the person's
          lifespan, while the squares stacked in a corner visually represent the
          total number of objects acquired. Additionally, the numeric form
          indicates the total number of objects, although there is no visual
          indication of the years in which the objects were acquired. Coronation
          is depicted by a circle, with the size of the circle representing the
          number of years in reign.
        </p>

        <p>
          This might have a very uneven layout if one century has a lot of
          acquirers and might not be easy to layout on smaller screens. Not sure
          if itâ€™s too stripped down, missing too much interesting information
          that the earlier versions had. Or if some things, like the lifespan
          (triangle), or years of reign is not obvious/necessary.
        </p>

        <h4>Pausing Prototype Development for Data Acquisition</h4>
        <p>
          Following the conceptualization of Version 3, I initiated work on a
          simple
          <a href="https://codepen.io/ongtiffany/full/mdRNOyY" target="_blank"
            >prototype</a
          >
          to bring the design to life. However, progress on the prototype was
          momentarily halted due to the unavailability of all the necessary
          data. Recognizing the importance of having comprehensive data to
          accurately represent the envisioned layout, I decided to temporarily
          pause development until the required information could be obtained.
          This break provided an opportunity to reassess the project's
          requirements and refine the approach to ensure that Version 3 would
          effectively meet its objectives once development resumed.
