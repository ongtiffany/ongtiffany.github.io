        <h4>Creating a Digital Platform for Exploring Heritage</h4>

        <p>
          The goal is to establish a digital platform that empowers individuals
          from various backgrounds across the nation to delve into and share
          their heritage, uncovering the elements that contribute to their
          'sense of place'. Firmly believing in the pivotal role heritage plays
          in fostering social, economic, and cultural enrichment within diverse
          communities in 21st century Britain, they have assembled a team
          comprising heritage professionals and enthusiasts.
        </p>

        <p>
          Funded by HEFCE and the Higher Education Innovation Fund, their
          initiative aims to serve as both a repository for educational
          resources and toolkits, as well as a space for showcasing digital
          heritage projects from a wide array of partners. Initially
          collaborating closely with schools in Tower Hamlets, their objective
          is to expand their outreach efforts. Through collaboration with the
          Edge Foundation, they also strive to assist schools in cultivating
          innovative approaches to learning about both tangible and intangible
          cultural heritage, thereby enhancing students' skill sets. Their focus
          extends beyond educational institutions; they are committed to
          fostering community engagement with heritage, adopting a grassroots
          approach by actively engaging with individuals and understanding their
          needs.
        </p>

        <h4>Enhancing User Experience in Digital Platform Development</h4>

        <p>
          As the designated designer within our project team, I closely
          collaborated with a developer, analyst, and project partners to shape
          the visual aspects and user experience of our digital platform. My
          role involved translating ideas into practical design elements that
          resonated with our audience, focusing on creating an interface that
          effectively communicated our project's goals while providing an
          engaging user experience. Drawing on my design expertise, I ensured
          the platform was both functional and visually appealing. Throughout
          the project, I fostered a collaborative environment, where ideas were
          shared and refined to achieve our shared vision.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="../img/project/sensingplace/university-of-winchester-site-screenshot.jpg"
            alt="Screenshot of the University of Winchester website"
          />
          <figcaption>
            The style was to be similar to the University of Winchester's
            website.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          In parallel with designing the platform's visual aspects, I led the
          user journey design process to ensure a seamless and intuitive
          experience for our platform users. This involved mapping out the
          various stages of user interaction, from initial engagement to task
          completion, and identifying opportunities to streamline the user
          journey. Through user research and feedback analysis, we gained
          valuable insights into user preferences and pain points, which
          informed our iterative design approach. Collaborating closely with the
          development team, we implemented user-centered design principles to
          create an interface that guided users through their exploration of
          heritage with clarity and efficiency. This focus on user journey
          design played a crucial role in enhancing the overall usability and
          effectiveness of our digital platform.

        <h4>Data and User Security</h4>
        <p>
          In addition to the design and development aspects of the project, it
          was imperative to dedicate attention to data protection and collection
          research. Ensuring the privacy and security of user data is paramount
          in any digital initiative, particularly one that involves the
          collection and storage of personal information. Therefore,
          comprehensive research was conducted to understand the legal and
          ethical considerations surrounding data protection laws and
          regulations. This involved examining relevant legislation such as GDPR
          (General Data Protection Regulation) and other industry standards to
          ensure compliance and mitigate any potential risks associated with
          data handling. Additionally, careful consideration was given to the
          methods of data collection, storage, and processing, with an emphasis
          on implementing robust security measures and privacy safeguards to
          protect sensitive information. By prioritizing data protection and
          collection research, we aimed to build trust with our users and
          demonstrate our commitment to safeguarding their privacy throughout
          their interaction with the digital platform.
        </p>

        <h4>User Feedback Gathering and Iterative Improvements</h4>

        <p>
          Given the time constraints surrounding user testing for the submission
          form, an innovative solution was devised to gather feedback
          efficiently. Recognising the importance of incorporating user input
          while also acknowledging the limited timeframe, a practical workaround
          was implemented. I devised a creative "hack" that allowed partners to
          distribute a printable version of the submission form to their
          students. The students would then use their smartphones to take a
          photo of the form, fill it out digitally, and take another photo
          capturing both the phone screen displaying the completed form and the
          printed form itself. These images were then collected and sent to me
          for review and analysis.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="../img/project/sensingplace/user-test-submissionform.jpg"
            alt="template and results of the user test submission form"
          />
          <figcaption>

            submission form
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          This method proved to be remarkably effective in soliciting user
          feedback within the given constraints. By leveraging readily available
          technology and streamlining the feedback process, we were able to
          gather valuable insights from users in a timely manner. Upon reviewing
          the submitted feedback, minor adjustments were made to the submission
          form based on the observed patterns and suggestions. This iterative
          approach not only ensured that the form met user expectations but also
          demonstrated our commitment to responsiveness and continuous
          improvement.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="../img/project/sensingplace/wireframes1.jpg"
            alt="wireframes"
          />
          <figcaption>Desktop to mobile wireframes using Adobe XD</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Following the completion of the wireframes, the next step involved
          prototyping the base framework to assess responsiveness and
          interactions. To achieve this, I created a
          <a href="https://codepen.io/ongtiffany/full/GXVXmN" target="_blank"
            >prototype</a
          >
          using HTML, CSS, which served as a foundational framework for testing
          purposes. The prototype was hosted on a staging server, allowing for
          easy access and collaboration with team members.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="../img/project/sensingplace/wireframes2.jpg"
            alt="wireframes of the submission form"
          />
          <figcaption>Wireframes of the submission form</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          As the prototyping phase progressed, I continued to refine and enhance
          the design, focusing on styling elements to ensure a visually
          appealing and cohesive user experience. Concurrently, I worked closely
          with a developer, collaborating on the staging server to integrate
          functionality and additional features into the prototype. This
          collaborative effort involved regular communication and iteration,
          with the developer implementing backend functionality while I focused
          on frontend design and aesthetics.
        </p>

        <p>
          Together, we iteratively refined the prototype, addressing any issues
          or inconsistencies that arose during testing. This collaborative
          approach facilitated the seamless integration of design and
          functionality, ultimately culminating in the development of the final
          website. By combining our respective skills and expertise, we were
          able to produce a website that nt only met the project requirements
          but also exceeded user expectations in terms of both design and
          functionality.
