            <h2>Red Riding Hood 2</h2>
            <h3>Emotion and Sentiment Visualisation</h3>
        </header>
        <article>
            <h4>Project:</h4>
            <p>I started another <a href="https://www.domestika.org/en/courses/2495-data-visualization-and-information-design-create-a-visual-model/course" target="_blank">data visualisation course</a> this time with Frederica Fragapane. I liked her style and was keen to learn about her process and methods which is explained in the course. Initially I thought of using a new topic and data set but there were a few ideas I didn't get to try out with my previous <a href="redridinghood.html" target="_blank">Red Riding Hood project</a>, and liked the idea of digging deeper more into it and see how differently it could be presented. I started the projected using my 10% time at <a href="https://kdl.kcl.ac.uk" target="_blank">King's Digital Lab</a>, but ended up using most of my personal time (about 95%) as it took a lot longer than I expected and I had a couple of weeks of leave so took the opportunity to work on the bulk of it, but continued weeks after. 
                
                <h4>Process:</h4>
                <p><i>Note: </i> I took notes along the way to try improve my documentation process but it's turned into quite a long read.</p>
                <h5>Background</h5>
                <p>In my previous project of <a href="redridinghood.html" target="_blank">Red Riding Hood</a>, a colleague gave me the idea to add sentiment analysis to the inner circles which represent each word to add an extra layer of data and meaning. I had little knowledge of sentiment analysis so had to look it up to understand the basics. As I dug a bit deeper, I thought of different ways to represent the sentiment data that could be visually quite interesting. I wanted to show the sentiment for all the words by putting them around in a circle to be able to identify their position on the page, rather than the random placement of circles I had. I tried a few different ways but it they all changed the look of the "trees" too much and so left it minimal, just showing the top 20 positive and negative words, represented by light and dark outline circles, and also the page sentiment, represented by arcs above the page "tree". One of the methods in this second course was very similar to how I had tried to visualise the words previously placing data points around a circle.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>I was really excited to follow the process which involved putting the data in a radar graph and manually placing each data point to fit. The process was tedious and repetitive but I didn't mind that. What I did mind, after trying it out with some data, was that it was far too easy for me to make an error with the placement and I didn't the risk of that happening. I knew I had to adapt to make it work for myself. The data also wasn't that clear in the previous project and I knew improvements could be made to the sentiment analysis and present that more clearly.</p>
                <h5>Data</h5>
                <p>I thought I could fast track this stage since I was reusing the same data but I was wrong. I had used the free online sentiment analysis tool <a href="http://monkeylearn.com" target="_blank">MonkeyLearn</a> in the previous project as it was the best I found at the time that fit my requirements. I wanted to use it again so both projects would have the same data but when I listed down the results it gave for all the words on the first page, I wasn't satified with the results. "hood"(91.1%) and "above" (86.3%) were the top negative words, compared to "died" (54.8%) and "lonely" (51.8%) what I think are more negative. I was rather annoyed I didn't spot this earlier for the previous project. I had already spent quite a while searching for a sentiment analysis tool that would fit my requirements previously so I knew the search for an alternative would not be easy. I really wanted to stick with MonkeyLearn but the results just didn't sit well with me. I searched for quite a long time, past the first few pages of what the search results would give, and finally came across <a href="https://www.twinword.com/api/sentiment-analysis.php" target="_blank">twinword</a>. </p>
                <p>The results were far better, "lonely" (-0.927) and "died" (-0.797) were the top negative words for the first page, and the process was also going to be much easier. With MonkeyLearn, I had to put the page text to get the page sentiment, and input each word individual to get the results. With <a href="https://www.twinword.com/api/sentiment-analysis.php" target="_blank">twinword</a>, I only had to put the page text and it gave the results of page sentiment and also results of all the positive and negative words on that page in one go so it would save me quite a lot of time. It doesn't give neutral word results but better that it doesn't as I would feel tempted to use it and really isn't needed.</p>

                <h5>Mockups</h5>


                <p>Once I was satisfied with the new and extra sentiment data I collected, I started with my usual process of sketching down some ideas and layouts.

                <figure>
                    <img src="../img/project/rrh2/sketchbook.jpg" alt="scans of line drawings in sketchbook">

                    </figcaption>
                </figure>


                <p>I went back to <a href="https://rawgraphs.io" target="_blank">RAWgraphs</a> to see if there was a graph I could use to get a similar effect. What I needed was a bar chart but arranged in a circle - radial bar chart but RAWgraphs didn't have that. I tried a few and the sunburst one was close but the data structure wasn't quite right. I changed things around in excel, something that I'm sure is not conventional and a bit crazy to do but I knew it would give me what I needed. I typed out a binary system of the letter count for each word per row for the first page, put it into RAWgraphs to make the sunburst chart, exported the svg to Illustrator, typed out each letter, of the word and deleted the additional data which was added for spacing. </p>

                <figure>

                    </figcaption>
                </figure>


                <p>I mocked up a version of how all the pages might look altogether when placed as a scatter plot with the page sentiment on the y axis and pages on the x axis.

                <h5>More Data</h5>

                <p>When browsing through<a href="https://www.twinword.com/api/sentiment-analysis.php" target="_blank">twinword's</a> site, I found out it had more tools and one I thought would be interesting to have alongside was <a href="https://www.twinword.com/api/emotion-analysis.php" target="_blank">emotion analysis</a> so though it would be interesting to add that for each page. I also wanted to show the sentences since there were always 8 on each page and also the rhymes as it was written as a poem. So I ended up having a rather long process. For each page my process would be:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Get the text from the original format</li>
                        <li>Compile in MS Word</li>
                        <li>Gather the data in Excel</li>
                        <li>Put the data in RawGraphs and export svg</li>
                        <li>Clean and type the letter in Illustrator</li>
                        <li>Get sentiment analysis data from twinword</li>
                        <li>Compile in MS Word</li>
                        <li>Colour sentiment to word in Illustrator </li>
                        <li>Style sentence and rhyme in Illustrator</li>
                        <li>Get emotion analysis in twinword</li>
                        <li>Compile in MS Word</li>
                        <li>Gather in Excel</li>
                        <li>Put the data in RawGraphs and export svg</li>
                        <li>Add emotions and clean up in Illustrator</li>
                        <li>Style words</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h5>Prototype</h5>

                    <p>It was taking me about 2-3 hours per page and I hadn't even finished 3 when I stopped to think. I could continue and finish them all but I also knew I wanted to eventually make the final piece interactive and responsive as it had quite a lot of information that would make the visualisation quite cluttered if it was shown in a static format. I decided to stop my work in Illustrator and start playing around with code.</p>
                        

                    <p>I know a lot of data developer/visualisers were using  D3 to make their very impressive data visualisation pieces. I had tried a few times to learn Javascript but never got it and usually spent a lot of time debugging my errors. I just wasn’t ready to try again just yet. I really liked working with CSS, had done quite a few side projects previously and have seen some amazing work with just CSS so wanted to see how far I could get with it, knowing it has its limitations.</p>

                    <p>I started making some prototypes in <a href="https://codepen.io/" target="_blank">codepen</a> and managed to come up with one that looked very similar to the design in Illustrator. It was responsive, semi-accessible for screen readers (I think), but some elements just didn’t scale well.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../img/project/rrh2/illustrator.jpg" alt="screenshots of codepen prototypes">

                            </figcaption>

                    <p>
                    The connecting lines, lines and dots to mark the begin and end of a sentence get misaligned when scaled due to some elements being position manually so I had to change the design a little. After a few more iterations, I came up with a version that removed the begin and end points and represented the start with a darker colour and gradually fading to a lighter colour ar the end of the sentence on curved lines, replaced the rhyme lines with two side borders on the rhyme words, one pair with solid and the other pair with double. 
                    </p>

                    <h5>Putting it together</h5>
                    <p>
                     I wanted to have a default overview of all sixteen pages and able to zoom in to view each one in more detail. At first I thought I could scale down each page and on hover over would expand but it kept flickering from each version during the interactions. After a few trials, I used the modal interaction which I used in several projects but added some transitions.
                    </p>
