        <h4>Project:</h4>
        <p>
          Freemasonry is one of the oldest social and charitable organisations
          in the world. Organised freemasonry began in 1717, when freemasons
          from four London lodges met to form the world’s first Grand Lodge in
          the Goose and Gridiron tavern. During this time there was a boom in
          magazines, or periodicals, emerging from Britain’s busy city culture
          spurred on by the discussions in coffee houses and taverns. There were
          established titles aimed at both men and women specifically. So it was
          no surprise that several periodicals produced for freemasons appear
          toward the end of the century. Few complete series of these
          periodicals have survived in libraries and they have only limited
          indexes. Masonic Periodicals Online enables the most significant
          masonic periodicals from the period 1790 to 1900 to be searched.

          I was the designer on this project at
          <a href="https://kdl.kcl.ac.uk" target="_blank">King's Digital Lab</a>
          working with one developer and an analyst. Similar to the

          project, this project was done just after so it used a lot of the same
          interfaces and journeys. It also was an opportunity to improve and
          experiment with new ideas, layouts and interfaces.

          A change of colours and fonts was implemented a few years after along
          with an accessibility assessment by another designer in the team.
