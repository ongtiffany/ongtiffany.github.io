        <h4>Inspiration from the Little Pictures Project</h4>
        <p>
          I have been wanting to work on a data visualisation with climate data
          but never felt confident enough to until now and was excited to begin
          my next one using my personal and 10% time at my organisation,
          <a href="https://kdl.kcl.ac.uk" target="_blank">King's Digital Lab</a
          >. While searching for a climate-related dataset, I discovered the
          Little Pictures project from
          <a href="https://climate.esa.int/en/littlepictures/"
            >ESA Climate Office</a
          >. I was immediately drawn to the simplicity of their visuals. The
          open-source nature of the project and the straightforward data made it
          an ideal starting point. Their visuals became a direct inspiration for
          my own project.

        <h4>Initial Plan and Prototype</h4>
        <p>
          Initially, I planned to replicate 4–6 examples directly from Little
          Pictures, making slight style tweaks, integrating interaction with a
          pause and play button to scroll through years of data. I developed a
          prototype that I was quite happy with, but decided to change
          directions.

        <h4>Shifting Focus to Accessibility and Sustainability</h4>
        <p>
          I knew from reading articles like
          <a href="https://fossheim.io/writing/posts/accessible-dataviz-design/"
            >Sarah Fossheim’s</a
          >
          how difficult it is to make a data visualisation accessible for screen
          reader users. At the time, when I was researching using certain
          visualisation tools, it involved adding aria labels data points, alt
          text to images, having the replicate the dataset in another ways to
          accomodate different users, and seemed like a good opportunity to find
          other options combining it with the methods I have been building on
          with my past projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          The new concept involved making a more accessible and sustainable
          visualisation, still using climate data and visual inspiration from
          Little Pictures - hence the project name. It uses an HTML table
          output, styled in various ways, allowing users to choose their
          preferred way of reading the data. Sustainability was ensured by
          dynamically sourcing data from JSON, using JavaScript for output, and
          relying only on CSS for styling. This approach eliminated dependencies
          and reduced code complexity.
        </p>
        <h4>Designing with Intentional Constraints</h4>
        <p>
          To maintain focus on the project’s core concepts, I deliberately
          limited the design. I avoided gradients, used a black-and-white
          palette, and incorporated only simple chart elements. This helped keep
          my efforts directed toward functionality rather than visual
          experimentation. For the card layout, I had a few sources of
          inspiration and mocked a few versions in Illustrator before moving on
          to coding the prototype.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="../img/project/littlepictures/illustrator.jpg"
            alt="many frames and images compiled together showing work in progress"
          />
          <figcaption>
            Screenshot of Illustrator file showing layout ideas, inspiration and
            mockups
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h4>Development Steps</h4>
        <p>
          The development process was non-linear, requiring multiple iterations
          to refine each step:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>JSON to HTML conversion</li>
          <li>Adding and styling tabs</li>
          <li>Styling the visual tab</li>
          <li>Styling the bar chart</li>
          <li>Styling the line chart</li>
          <li>Card layout</li>
          <li>Styling cards</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Styling the bar chart was straightforward, involving adjustments to
          element heights based on data values. However, styling the line chart
          was trickier. Using a clip-path method to draw dynamic lines based on
          data values, I encountered alignment issues. Although I explored an
          alternative method with better output, its lack of responsiveness
          forced me to postpone further refinement.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="../img/project/littlepictures/graph-prototypes.jpg"
            alt="4 frames showing line graph, bar chart and table formats"
          />
          <figcaption>Screenshot of graph prototypes</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h4>Layout Challenges and Solutions</h4>
        <p>
          For the card layout, I initially tried to use Flexbox but switched to
          CSS Grid after encountering challenges. Using this
          <a href="https://cssgrid-generator.netlify.app">CSS Grid generator</a>
          helped me understand and implement the layout effectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          Browser testing revealed alignment issues, particularly on Firefox and
          Chrome, which were not present in Safari. After two days of
          troubleshooting, I resolved the issue by adding position:relative; to
          the tbody. Additional media queries were necessary to address scaling
          inconsistencies.
        </p>

        <h4>Data Integration and Visual Styling</h4>
        <p>
          Integrating the data turned out to be more complex than expected. Some
          datasets needed simplification, and I had to source alternatives when
          the originals were too detailed. The javascript had to be amended
          repeatedly to allow it to dynamically adapt to new features and data.
          Previously, I would have to bother a developer (usually my partner),
          but this time, I had ChatGPT and even though it wasn’t always smooth
          sailing, it was a huge help and also helped me learn as it explained
          and commented the code very clearly. When it came to styling, I
          focused on using simple graphic elements such as lines, rectangles,
          and circles.
        </p>
        <h4>Feedback and Enhancements</h4>
        <p>
          I had planned to get feedback from my whole team but I was so delayed
          I only managed to show a couple and already I could tell that it
          wasn’t that well received compared to my past projects. I had expected
          it as there was no colour and minimal styling but still it didn’t feel
          great. I decided add the animation that scrolled though the data that
          I initially abandoned, but this time to have it on hover, in hope it
          would give more interest, not only for my ego but more importantly to
          highlight the data which had a strong message which I was drawn into
          originally not only by the subject but also by the visuals.
        </p>
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>
          The Little Pictures-inspired project became a meaningful exploration
          of accessible and sustainable data visualisation. Although challenges
          remained, the project laid the groundwork for future improvements and
          reinforced the importance of balancing functionality, inclusivity, and
          visual appeal.
