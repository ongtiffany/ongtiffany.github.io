        <h4>Inspiration from the Little Pictures Project</h4>
        <p>
          I have been wanting to work with climate data for a while but never
          felt confident, until now. After a busy period, I was ready to start
          working on a data visualisation using my personal and 10% time at my
          organisation,
          <a href="https://kdl.kcl.ac.uk" target="_blank">King's Digital Lab</a
          >. While searching for a climate-related dataset, I discovered the
          Little Pictures project from the
          <a href="https://climate.esa.int/en/littlepictures/"
            >ESA Climate Office</a
          >. I was immediately drawn to the simplicity of their visuals. The
          open-source nature of the project and the straightforward data made it
          an ideal starting point. Their visuals also became a direct
          inspiration for this project.

        <h4>Initial Plan and Prototype</h4>
        <p>
          Initially, I planned to replicate 4–6 examples directly from Little
          Pictures, making slight style tweaks, integrating interaction with a
          pause and play button to scroll through years of data. I developed a
          prototype that I was quite happy with, but decided to change
          directions.

        <h4>Shifting Focus to Accessibility and Sustainability</h4>
        <p>
          I knew from reading articles like
          <a href="https://fossheim.io/writing/posts/accessible-dataviz-design/"
            >Sarah Fossheim’s</a
          >
          how difficult it is to make a data visualisation accessible for screen
          reader users. At the time, whilst researching, most visualisation
          tools and platforms involved adding aria labels data points, alt text
          to images, having the replicate the dataset in another ways to
          accommodate different users, and seemed like a good opportunity to
          explore other options combining it with the methods I have been
          building on with my past projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          The new concept involved making a more accessible and sustainable
          visualisation, still using climate data and visual inspiration from
          Little Pictures - hence keeping the project name. It uses one HTML
          table output per dataset, styled in three different ways, allowing
          users a variety of ways to view the data, and screen reader users will
          be able to read the table output. Sustainability was ensured by
          dynamically sourcing data from JSON, using JavaScript for output, and
          relying only on CSS for styling. This approach eliminated dependencies
          and reduced code complexity.
        </p>
        <h4>Designing with Intentional Constraints</h4>
        <p>
          To maintain focus on the project’s core concepts, I deliberately
          limited the design. I avoided gradients, used a black-and-white
          palette, and incorporated only simple elements. This helped keep my
          efforts directed toward functionality rather than visual
          experimentation. For the card layout, I had a few sources of
          inspiration and mocked up several versions in Illustrator before
          moving on to coding the prototype.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="../img/project/littlepictures/illustrator.jpg"
            alt="many frames and images compiled together showing work in progress"
          />
          <figcaption>

            mockups
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h4>Development Steps</h4>
        <p>
          These were the process steps I took, although not always linear and
          required multiple iterations to refine:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>JSON to HTML conversion</li>
          <li>Adding and styling tabs</li>
          <li>Styling the visual tab</li>
          <li>Styling the bar chart</li>
          <li>Styling the line chart</li>
          <li>Card layout</li>
          <li>Styling cards</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Styling the bar chart was straightforward, involving adjustments to
          element heights based on data values. However, styling the line chart
          was trickier. Using a clip-path method to draw dynamic lines based on
          data values, I encountered alignment issues. Although I explored an
          alternative method with better output, its lack of responsiveness
          forced me to postpone further refinement.
        </p>

            alt="4 frames showing line graph, bar chart and table formats"
          />
          <figcaption>Screenshot of graph prototypes</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h4>Layout Challenges and Solutions</h4>
        <p>
          For the card layout, I initially tried to use Flexbox but switched to
          CSS Grid after encountering challenges. Using this
          <a href="https://cssgrid-generator.netlify.app">CSS Grid generator</a>
          helped me understand and implement the layout effectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          Browser testing revealed alignment issues, particularly on Firefox and
          Chrome, which were not present in Safari. After two days of
          troubleshooting, I resolved the issue by adding position:relative; to
          the tbody. Additional media queries were necessary to address scaling
          inconsistencies.
        </p>

        <h4>Data Integration and Visual Styling</h4>
        <p>
          Integrating the data turned out to be more complex than expected. Some
          datasets needed simplification, and I had to source alternatives when
          the originals were too detailed. The javascript had to be amended
          repeatedly to allow it to dynamically adapt to new features and data.
          Previously, I would have to bother a developer (usually my partner),
          but this time, I had ChatGPT and even though it wasn’t always smooth
          sailing, it was a huge help and also helped me learn as it explained
          and commented the code very clearly. When it came to styling the first
          and default 'Visual' view, I focused on using simple graphic elements
          such as lines, rectangles, and circles, using size and position to
          depict the data values.
        </p>
        <h4>Feedback and Enhancements</h4>
        <p>
          I had planned to get feedback from my whole team but I was so delayed
          I only managed to show a couple and already I could tell that it
          wasn’t that well received compared to my pevious projects. I had
          expected it as there was no colour and minimal styling but still it
          didn’t feel great. I decided add the animation that scrolled though
          the data that I initially abandoned, but this time to have it on
          hover, in hope it would give more interest, and more importantly to
          highlight the data which had a strong message which I was drawn into
          originally not only by the subject but also by the visuals.

          <h5>Prototype - animation on hover</h5>
        </div>
        <p>
          I made a version with animation on hover but after some feedback from
          more testing, decided to add a button as some people found it
          confusing when the animations were triggered. And also changed the
          styling with some slight gradients and shadows to the visual styles.
        </p>

        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>
          The Little Pictures-inspired project became a meaningful exploration
          of accessible and sustainable data visualisation. Although challenges
          remained, the project laid the groundwork for future improvements and
          reinforced the importance of balancing functionality, inclusivity, and
          visual appeal.
