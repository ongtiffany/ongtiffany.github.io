        <h2>Trinity Mirror</h2>
        <h3>Publishing</h3>
        <p>
          Below is a small selection of the work I did when I was at Trinity
          Mirror, now known as
          <a href="https://www.reachplc.com/" target="_blank">Reach</a>. Working
          across many different departments, there was always work to be done.
          And a wide range of projects, from designing advertisments, building
          assets, putting together email newsletters, forms, widgets for news
          stories, it was a great experience in a buzzing environment.

        <h4>Enhancing the Mirror Eeditions Newspaper App</h4>
        <p>
          Collaborating closely with a product manager, the project commenced
          with a thorough analysis of the app's existing interface and user
          feedback. Understanding the requirements and objectives guided the
          design process towards creating a more intuitive and visually
          appealing user experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          The initial phase involved designing navigation icons to streamline
          user interactions and enhance navigation within the app. This included
          conceptualizing and creating icons that resonated with the Mirror's
          brand identity while ensuring clarity and simplicity for users.
        </p>

        <p>
          Subsequent stages focused on refining the user journey through the
          creation of help screens and subscription pages. These elements aimed
          to provide users with clear instructions and information about app
          features and subscription options, fostering a seamless onboarding
          process and encouraging user engagement.
        </p>

          />
          <figcaption>

          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          As the design elements took shape, they were implemented in
          Illustrator and passed on to the development team for integration into
          the app. Throughout the development phase, rigorous testing and
          iteration were conducted to ensure that the design elements functioned
          as intended and aligned with the project objectives.
        </p>

        <p>
          Following the successful implementation of the redesigned elements,
          the updated Mirror newspaper app for tablets was released to users.
          Post-launch evaluation and feedback mechanisms were established to
          gather user insights and refine the app further based on user
          interactions and preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
          The redesign of the Mirror newspaper app for tablets exemplifies a
          collaborative effort aimed at enhancing user engagement and
          experience. By incorporating user feedback, iterative design
          processes, and rigorous testing, the project succeeded in delivering
          an interface that resonated with users and effectively met their
          needs.
