                    <h4>Crafting a Family Bond</h4>
                    <p>This was spontaneous weekend project which came about when my colleague offered some cotton string cutoffs from hand weaving a kākahu, a traditional  Māori cloak she was lovingly weaving for her sister with beautiful patterns, colours and finished with feathers. 
                     </p> <figure>

                        </figcaption>
                      </figure>
                    <p> Inspired by the cultural significance of kākahu as family heirlooms, I thought it would be a nice opportunity to craft something with my kids, connecting it to our family. It had been four years since we last made a data visualisation together, and I was ready to try another one. The activity needed to be engaging, relatable, and simple enough for my children, while remaining manageable for me.</p>




                    
                    <h4>From Concept to Collaboration</h4>
                    <p>After brainstorming and searching for ideas with my children, we settled on creating round macrame-inspired pieces that could double as coasters. Each person would knot their age number in their favourite colour, starting with the children, followed by the parents.
                      Initial sketches engaged the kids, leading to discussions about colours and counting age markers for family members.
                      Seeing their enthusiasm, I decided to include grandparents to expand the project. Although we initially considered showing two family sides merging, it was too complex, so we opted for a simpler sequence from youngest to oldest.
</p>

                     <p>
                      Macrame wasn’t suitable for the spiral pattern I envisioned due to its complexity and need for longer strings.
Switching to a wrapping method offered simplicity and allowed us to add frayed sections, a detail the kids loved, to indicate male or female.
After testing, we decided on frayed edges for females and knots for males. Their father suggested placing frayed edges at the start or end of sections to balance the design.
                     </p> 
                      



                     <h4>Preparation and Process</h4>
                     <p>
                     With the concept finalised, I created a plan and outlined steps to make the craft approachable:
                      <ol>
                            <li>Make dye labels: Write names and match colours.</li>
                            <li>Prepare the string amounts.</li>
                            <li>Create dye.</li>
                            <li>Dye the string, rinse, and dry.</li>
                            <li>Wrap string according to years (age).</li>
                            <li>Sew into a circle.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>

                    </figure>

                    <p>Dyeing was a delicate and time-consuming process, requiring precise colour blending to match shades. Adjustments were necessary when colours appeared too light or off-tone, which naturally extended the timeline.</p>

                    <h4>Assembly and Reflection</h4>
                    <p>
                    
                      The next morning, after some time in the oven to dry the the rest of the strings, the wrapping started. The act and counting each wrap brought moments of reflection, especially when working on older generations. Then came the last part of sewing it together which which proved extremely difficult and slow. I really didn't want to, but in desperation, when some wrappings started coming apart with all the moving about from the sewing, I resorted to using the hot glue gun to stabilise the structure. This unfortunately made the reverse rather unslightly but at least it held together well and we decided could be a small wall hanging.<figure>

                    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                    <p>The finished piece represents not only our family data but also the bonding and creativity shared in making it. Through this collaborative project, we deepened our connections and created a potential little heirloom and a memory, that celebrates family in a tactile way.</p>
