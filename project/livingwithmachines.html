        <h4>Data-Driven Insights into the Past</h4>
        <p>
          The Living with Machines project represents a groundbreaking
          multidisciplinary collaboration involving the British Library, the
          Alan Turing Institute, and universities including Cambridge, East
          Anglia, Exeter, Queen Mary, and King’s College London. Its mission is
          to explore historical narratives by employing data science, machine
          learning, and public engagement activities, including crowdsourcing
          tasks on the Zooniverse platform. A core focus has been analysing
          19th-century newspapers to uncover insights into societal shifts
          during the industrial age.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2022 and 2023 the team ran a series of tasks in the citizen science
          platform Zooniverse. They asked members of the public to look at
          articles from 19th century newspapers that mentioned specific types of
          machine that they thought would yield interesting results.

        <h4>Key Research Strands and Outputs for Public Engagement</h4>
        <p>
          The project includes two primary research strands, each with
          interactive notebooks designed to analyse data, visualise findings and
          engage diverse audiences:
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>The Language of Accidents</strong> notebook explores how
          mechanisation influenced accident trends. It offers visualisations of
          accident frequencies by year, geographic distribution, and victim
          demographics, such as age and gender. The tool also includes
          background information about the data sources, allowing users to
          contextualise their findings.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The Language of Mechanisation</strong> notebook investigates
          how words related to mechanisation evolved over time. It enables users
          to explore changes in word meanings by year, location, and newspaper
          publication, offering a rich view of language dynamics in the 19th
          century.

        <h4>A Collaborative and Adaptive Design Process</h4>
        <p>
          The project team conducted detailed discussions to understand
          datasets, such as crowdsourced annotations and metadata from
          historical newspapers. A range of graphs were created in jupyter
          notebooks to beter understand the data and better understanding the
          direction to take.
        </p>

        <p>
          Using a Miro board, the team mapped out iterative design solutions,
          ensuring alignment with project goals and audience needs. Various
          technical solutions were explored, with constraints like time and
          budget guided the decision to adopt existing notebook platforms, such
          as Observable and Jupyter. While Observable’s default design system
          introduced limitations, the team focused on enhancing user experience
          by refining the narrative structure, simplifying terminology, and
          testing chart types and interactions, designed to engage a broad
          audience. Accessibility considerations were prioritised, although some
          challenges, such as colour-based visual distinctions and
          browser-specific issues, were noted.

        <h4>User-Centred Testing and Iterative Refinements</h4>
        <p>
          Usability testing was conducted in the latter stages of development
          through open-ended questionnaires, allowing stakeholders to clarify
          objectives, user needs, and to validate the notebooks’ design. Two
          rounds of testing, each with 8–10 participants, provided quick
          feedback on functionality and usability. Open-ended questions guided
          the sessions, highlighting key issues, which were promptly addressed.
          Both notebooks allow users to drill down to the original source
          documents, linking individual data points with contextual references.
        </p>

        <p>
          Iterative adjustments continued to be incorporated based on feedback,
          ensuring the notebooks remained intuitive and engaging. This
          continuous refinement reflected the project’s commitment to delivering
          tools that met diverse audience needs, from quick overviews to
          detailed data exploration.

        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>
          The Living with Machines project exemplifies how interdisciplinary
          collaboration and thoughtful design can reimagine historical research.
          By blending data science, public engagement, and accessible tools, it
          has illuminated new perspectives on 19th-century societal changes. The
          project’s success underscores the importance of integrating research,
          design, and user input to create impactful, lasting contributions to
          our understanding of history.
