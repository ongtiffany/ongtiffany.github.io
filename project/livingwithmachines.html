        <h4>Data-Driven Insights into the Past</h4>
        <p>
          The Living with Machines project represents a multidisciplinary
          collaboration involving the British Library, the Alan Turing
          Institute, and universities including Cambridge, East Anglia, Exeter,
          Queen Mary, and King’s College London. Its mission is to explore
          historical narratives by employing data science, machine learning, and
          public engagement activities. A core focus has been analysing
          19th-century newspapers to uncover insights into societal shifts
          during the industrial age.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2022 and 2023 the team ran a series of crowdsourcing tasks on the
          citizen science platform Zooniverse. They asked members of the public
          to look at articles from 19th century newspapers that mentioned
          specific types of machine that they thought would yield interesting
          results.

        <h4>Key Research Strands and Outputs for Public Engagement</h4>
        <p>
          The project includes two primary research strands, each with
          interactive notebooks designed to analyse data, visualise findings and
          engage diverse audiences:
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>The Language of Accidents</strong> notebook explores how
          mechanisation influenced accident trends. It offers visualisations of
          accident frequencies by year, geographic distribution, and victim
          demographics, such as age and gender. The tool also includes
          background information about the data sources, allowing users to
          contextualise their findings.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The Language of Mechanisation</strong> notebook investigates
          how words related to mechanisation evolved over time. It enables users
          to explore changes in word meanings by year, location, and newspaper
          publication, offering a rich view of language dynamics in the 19th
          century.

        <h4>A Collaborative and Adaptive Design Process</h4>
        <p>
          The project team conducted detailed discussions to understand
          datasets, such as crowdsourced annotations and metadata from
          historical newspapers. A range of graphs were created in jupyter
          notebooks to better understand the data and the direction to take.
        </p>

        <p>
          Using a Miro board, the team mapped out iterative design solutions,
          ensuring alignment with project goals and audience needs. Time and
          budget constraints guided the decision to adopt an existing notebook
          platform instead of more a customised technical solution. Observable
          was chosen for it’s ability to process and quickly render multiple
          complex data visualisations, allow for exploratory explanation
          content, and collaborative process. With the design limitations of the
          platform, the team focused on enhancing user experience by simplifying
          terminology, refining the narrative structure, chart types and
          interactions, to engage a broad audience. Accessibility considerations
          were prioritised, although some challenges, such as colour-based
          visual distinctions and browser-specific issues, were unable to be
          rectified.

        <h4>User-Centred Testing and Iterative Refinements</h4>
        <p>
          Usability testing, each with 8–10 participants guided the sessions
          with open-ended questions, provided quick feedback on functionality
          and usability, highlighting key issues were analysed and addressed.
          Both notebooks allow users to drill down to the original source
          documents, linking individual data points with contextual references.
        </p>

          Iterative adjustments continued to be incorporated through the
          project, ensuring the notebooks remained intuitive and engaging. This
          continuous refinement reflected the project’s commitment to delivering
          tools that met diverse audience needs, from quick overviews to
          detailed data exploration.

        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>
          The Living with Machines project exemplifies how interdisciplinary
          collaboration and thoughtful design can reimagine historical research.
          By blending data science, public engagement, and technology, it has
          illuminated new perspectives on 19th-century societal changes. The
          project’s success underscores the importance of integrating research,
          design, and user input to create impactful, lasting contributions to
          our understanding of history.
