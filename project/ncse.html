        <h4>Transforming a Historic Digital Archive</h4>
        <p>
          The Nineteenth-Century Serials Edition (NCSE) project represents a
          comprehensive online repository of historical periodicals and
          newspapers, comprising over 400,000 articles sourced from six
          nineteenth-century publications. Led by the Centre for Computing in
          the Humanities at King's College London, this ambitious project aimed
          to digitize and manage a diverse array of materials spanning 84 years
          of publication history.
        </p>
        <p>
          Initiated in 2005, the primary challenge was to create a digital
          management system capable of handling such a vast volume of content.
          This necessitated the design and development of innovative tools to
          assist researchers in accessing materials while also encouraging new
          approaches to scholarly inquiry. In response to feedback from partners
          and users, the project underwent a redesign in 2018, with a focus on
          enhancing user experience and functionality. Limited resources
          constrained the scope of improvements, but selected enhancements were
          prioritized based on user feedback from the 2008 edition.The
          redesigned frontend took into account user preferences and features
          deemed useful from the previous edition, ensuring a more intuitive and
          engaging browsing experience. While resource limitations posed
          challenges, the project team remained committed to delivering a
          refined and accessible platform for historical research.
        </p>
        <p>
          The NCSE redesign project represents a collaborative effort to
          preserve and promote access to valuable historical resources. Through
          strategic design decisions and iterative improvements, the platform
          continues to serve as a valuable resource for researchers and
          historians worldwide.
        </p>

        <h4>Enhancing User Experience and Accessibility</h4>

        <p>
          In my role as the designer at King's Digital Lab, I collaborated
          closely with a team comprising two developers and an analyst for this
          project. It represented one of my initial undertakings in refreshing
          an existing site boasting an extensive database of items. Working on
          this project presented a unique challenge as we had only screenshots
          from the old site to reference, as the system was no longer
          functional. Despite this limitation, it became apparent during our
          initial assessment that the user experience fell short in terms of
          ease and intuitiveness.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="../img/project/ncse/screenshot-oldsite.jpg"
            alt="Screenshots of old site"
          />
          <figcaption>Screenshots of old site</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Our primary focus centred on enhancing the user journey and
          navigation, particularly within the two main facsimile pathways:
          "explore" and "search." We sought to streamline the process, making it
          more intuitive and seamless for users to navigate through the vast
          array of materials available on the platform.
        </p>
        <figure>

          <p class="image-caption">
            <figcaption>Site map</figcaption>
          </p>
        </figure>

        <p>
          In line with the partners' emphasis on consistency, our goal was to
          preserve the familiar colours and visual elements that users had grown
          accustomed to from the previous version of the platform. However, as
          part of our commitment to inclusivity and accessibility, we conducted
          a thorough assessment to evaluate the platform's adherence to
          accessibility standards. This evaluation highlighted areas where
          improvements were needed to enhance accessibility for all users.
          During the design process, we took the opportunity to incorporate
          small additions that added charm and personality to the platform. For
          instance, we integrated endearing characters inspired by elements from
          the old banner, injecting a touch of whimsy into the user experience.
          These subtle embellishments served to delight users while maintaining
          the platform's overall aesthetic coherence.

        </figure>

        <h4>Communicating Overview Insights Through Data Visualization</h4>
        <p>
          Recognizing the significance of data within the interface, we saw an
          opportunity to leverage it to unveil statistical insights about NCSE
          that transcended textual descriptions. To achieve this, we curated
          data visualization graphs on the facsimile page, offering a
          comprehensive overview of all publications through a timeline
          representation. Additionally, individual publication graphs were
          meticulously crafted to depict the quantity of various items such as
          text, pictures, and advertisements. Ensuring seamless accessibility
          across various devices, including small screens like mobile devices,
          was a priority during interface adaptation. Although some features
          operated slightly differently on mobile devices, we ensured a
          consistent and intuitive user experience across all platforms.
          Considerable effort was invested in redesigning the layout and user
          journey, with a primary focus on the "explore" and "search" sections.
          To enhance search functionality, we introduced two distinct views â€“
          grid for a visual experience and list for a more textual approach. We
          also streamlined filters to facilitate smoother navigation. In the
          "explore" section, we aimed to provide users with a comprehensive
          overview of all periodicals by incorporating overview statistics such
          as publication years and quantity published. Simple yet impactful bar
          charts were integrated, categorizing data to enhance visual
          comprehension. I made a
          <a href="https://codepen.io/ongtiffany/full/OoqwrZ" target="_blank"
            >prototype</a
          >
          using mock data but the ratio of the actual data was quite different
          so would have done it differently in hindsight.
        </p>

        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>
          The NCSE redesign project embodies a collaborative endeavour to
          transform a vast historical archive into an accessible and
          user-friendly digital platform. Through meticulous design decisions
          and iterative improvements, the project team succeeded in enhancing
          the user experience and accessibility of the platform while preserving
          its rich historical content. By leveraging data visualisation and
          refining the user journey, the redesigned NCSE platform continues to
          serve as a valuable resource for researchers and historians worldwide,
          facilitating deeper insights into the
          <a href="https://ncse.ac.uk/periodicals/" target="_blank"
            >nineteenth-century periodicals</a
          >
          and newspapers that shape our understanding of history.
